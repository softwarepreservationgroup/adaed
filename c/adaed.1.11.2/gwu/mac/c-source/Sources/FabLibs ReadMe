This software uses the MoreFiles library 1.2.2 by Jim Luther (Apple Macintosh Developer Technical Support).The MoreFiles notice says:Copyright © 1992-1994 Apple Computer, Inc.**	All rights reserved.****	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without**	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the**	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are**	not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code"**	after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,**	we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was**	descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.Since I made changes (the MoreFiles routines are compiled with C instead of Pascal calling conventions), as a safeguard against Apple’s lawyers I chose not to redistribute the Apple code at all; you will have to download the latest version yourself, should you need it.
